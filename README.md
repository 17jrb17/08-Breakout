# 08-Breakout
I combined knowledge from the past projects to essentially make a game with breakable tiles, a scoring system with each tile equalling 1 point, and a life system that, if equals 0, produces a seperate "Game Over" screen. The ball can also respawn by clicking with the mouse after losing a life. Basically this is just a very basic and simple game of breakout.
